# Room Cleanliness Classification Using TensorFlow
This project applies supervised machine learning to classify rooms as either clean or messy based on image data. Leveraging Python and TensorFlow, the model is trained to identify patterns and features indicative of room cleanliness, demonstrating the use of deep learning in image classification tasks.

## Key Features
* Data Preprocessing: Preparing room images by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting the data to improve model generalization.
* Model Development: Creating and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images into "clean" or "messy" categories.
* Evaluation: Assessing the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
* Visualization: Visualizing training progress, classification results, and performance metrics through charts and graphs.
## Tools and Technologies
* Python: For data analysis and model development.
* TensorFlow & Keras: For building, training the deep learning model, image processing, and augmentation.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and performance analysis.
## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of rooms, categorized as either clean or messy. It includes diverse examples of different room types and levels of cleanliness to ensure robust training and evaluation.

# Results
The trained model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between clean and messy rooms, offering potential applications in home automation, cleaning services, or organizational tools.

# Future Scope
Deploying the model in real-time applications, such as a mobile app for room assessment.
Expanding the dataset to include more room types and conditions for improved model robustness.
Exploring transfer learning with pre-trained models for enhanced classification performance.
